# Spark


Apache Sparkâ„¢ and Delta Lake have seen immense growth over the past several years, becoming the de-facto data processing 
and AI engine in enterprises today due to its speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. 

Spark unifies data and AI by simplifying data preparation at massive scale across various sources, providing a consistent 
set of APIs for both data engineering and data science workloads, as well as seamless integration with popular AI frameworks 
and libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, R and SciKit-Learn. 

And Delta Lake brings data reliability and performance to data 
lakes, with capabilities like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, DML commands, and time travel.


# Speed
Run workloads 100x faster.
Apache Spark achieves high performance for both batch and streaming data, using a state-of-the-art DAG scheduler, 
a query optimizer, and a physical execution engine.


# Ease of Use
Write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL.

Spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps. And you can use it interactively from 
the Scala, Python, R, and SQL shells.


# Generality
Combine SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.

Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming.
You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.


# Runs Everywhere
Spark runs on Hadoop, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources.

You can run Spark using its standalone cluster mode, on EC2, on Hadoop YARN, on Mesos, or on Kubernetes. Access data in HDFS, 
Alluxio, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Apache Hive, and hundreds of other data sources.
